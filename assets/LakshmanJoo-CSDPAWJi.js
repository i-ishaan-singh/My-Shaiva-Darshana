Born as Lakshman Raina, his spiritual yearnings began at a tender age of three. He experienced deep states of absorption that he called "badhi bhod" (greater than the greatest). Recognizing his inclination, his family provided him with guidance from their family priest (Swami Ram), introducing him to the path of Kashmir Shaivism.
                        
                        He received initiation from Swami Mahatabakak, immersing himself in the study and practice of Kashmir Shaivism.

He journeyed throughout India, seeking out and engaging with other prominent spiritual figures of his time.  These encounters, including interactions with M.K. Gandhi, Sri Aurobindo, and Ramana Maharshi, likely broadened his perspective and enriched his understanding of the spiritual path.

                        Eventually, Lakshmanjoo returned to his roots in Kashmir. He settled on the eastern shore of the picturesque Dal Lake and established an ashram that continues to serve as a center for learning and practice within the Kashmir Shaiva tradition.  While maintaining a period of solitude each winter, he dedicated himself to teaching and sharing the wisdom of Kashmir Shaivism with all who came seeking guidance.

                        Recognizing the growing interest in Kashmir Shaivism beyond Kashmir, Lakshmanjoo established the Universal Shaiva Fellowship in the United States.
