                        Svatantrya is often understood in the context of liberation (Moksha). Svatantrya doesn't negate Maya entirely. It's about recognizing the limitations imposed by Maya while simultaneously utilizing our freedom to transcend them.

                        Svatantrya, in its essence, is liberation from these bondages. It's the recognition that the limitations we experience are not inherent to our true nature as Shiva-Atman.
