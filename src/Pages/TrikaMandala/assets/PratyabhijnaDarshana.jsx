It originated and flourished in the valleys of Kashmir, India. This philosophy aligns closely with the spiritual teachings found in the Upanishads and the Yoga Shastra, emphasizing self-realization and reflective wisdom.`}

This philosophy delves into the metaphysical aspects of existence, emphasizing the ultimate reunion of the individual self with the absolute.

This work systematically examines and refutes opposing viewpoints, particularly those of Buddhism and Vedanta, using Buddhist logic to solidify the Pratyabhijna position. The Īśvarapratyabhijñā-Vṛtti, Utpaladeva's own commentary on the Kārikā, further elaborates on the concepts and provides deeper insights.`}
