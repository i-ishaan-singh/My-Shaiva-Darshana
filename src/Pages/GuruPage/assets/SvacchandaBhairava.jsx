                 Lord Svacchanda Bhairava manifests out of his own free will and is the highest form of power. He transcends the realm of a mere mythological figure, serving as a potent symbol for self-realization, liberation, and the dissolution of illusion.`}

                            He is envisioned as white in color, wide eyed, five-faced figure, each face representing a different aspect of his power. 
                            He has 18 arms with many weapons like noose, arrows, goad, a skull-topped staff, a damaru or drum, a bell, bow, trident, sword, shield, axe, etc. 
                            Adorned with serpents, a skull necklace, and a lion skin on his Hips, Elephant hide on his shoulders, he exudes an aura of untamed energy. 
                            He is shown along with his consort Aghoreshwari devi and standing on Savadhiva.
                            This fearsome exterior, however, serves as a gateway to a deeper understanding. Svacchanda Bhairava isn't merely a destroyer, he embodies the transformative power necessary to break free from the limitations of the ego and the illusory veils of Maya.
                            
                            Svacchanda Bhairava is considered the first manifest form of the Shiva Tattva which brought the knowledge of Shaiva Darshana to the world.`}
